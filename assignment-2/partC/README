Assignment 2: Inter-Process Synchronization and Concurrency

In this assignment, you will create three versions of a simple multi-process game. The three versions differ only in the type of synchronization they use: one uses busy-wait, another uses busy-wait with yield, and the third uses blocking semaphores. You will also measure the relative performance of these three versions of your multi-process game.
